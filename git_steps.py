print("""Git is a version control system that helps you save work and track your project/code changes over time.

Steps to modify or create new files using Visual Studio Code from GitHub by using Git commands:

Step 1:
git clone <paste the HTTPS link from GitHub>
→ This copies the project folder from GitHub to your computer.

Step 2:
cd <folder name>
→ 'cd' means "change directory" — it lets you go inside the project folder.

Step 3:
git status
→ This shows the status of your files.
→ It tells you if there are untracked files (new files not yet added).

Step 4:
git add .
→ This adds all new or modified files to the staging area (getting ready to be saved).

Step 5:
git commit -m "add new paragraph"
→ This saves your changes with a message explaining what you did.

Final Step:
git push origin main
→ This uploads your committed changes to GitHub, to the main branch.
